      <h1>Working Backwards from the End State</h1>
      <p>
        Over the last few days we've been leaning heavily on a simple trio of
        files: <code>end_state.md</code>, <code>todo.md</code> and
        <code>chronicler.md</code>. Together they keep development focused and
        provide a running memory of what changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>end_state.md</code> file lays out the vision&mdash;a calm,
        trustworthy archiving robot. Before touching code we read it to make sure
        every task lines up with that goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there <code>todo.md</code> gives us bite‑sized tasks. Recent
        examples include pruning manual sync buttons and polishing the admin
        dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each time a task is tackled we jot a quick note in
        <code>chronicler.md</code>. It's our lightweight changelog and helps the
        next agent know exactly what happened. Skimming it shows the move to
        server‑side admin pages, new logging hooks, and a steady march toward
        that calm confidence vibe.
      </p>
      <h2>Why it Works</h2>
      <p>
        This loop of vision → tasks → log keeps the project grounded. Every
        action ties back to the end state, while the chronicle provides context
        and momentum. It's low friction but surprisingly powerful.
      </p>
      <h2>How We Could Improve</h2>
      <p>
        The naming could be clearer. <code>chronicler.md</code> is fun but maybe
        <code>progress_log.md</code> or similar would be more obvious. Automated
        summaries or linking entries to pull requests would help too.
      </p>
      <p>Iterating on the process itself is part of the journey.</p>
