# END STATE

PESOS: End State Specification

🧭 Core Vision

PESOS is a personal archiving and publishing platform designed to be calm, trustworthy, and low-pressure. It focuses on quiet confidence and minimalism for everyday users, while enabling richer creative publishing and tracking for advanced ones.

🧑‍💻 Primary Use Cases (Free Tier)

Users set up an account and connect feeds/projects.

The site checks and archives updates automatically (default: every 3 hours).

Users receive a calm status dashboard:

"All good! You have 309 items stored. Last one was 10 days ago."

Midweek Behavior:

Shows how many things are queued

Shows when they’ll be processed

❌ No manual fetch button — system provides confidence through clarity

Mobile Experience:

Simple background image

Status text (e.g. "All good!", "5 items queued")

Minimal UI. Like checking a postcard from your archive robot

🔐 Data Portability & Trust

Users can always download their content

Data format is clear and documented (e.g. JSON, Markdown, CSV)

Transparent logs show what's been backed up and queued

Admin mode includes verbose, diagnosable logs

💸 Paid Features (Planned)

LinkTree Competitor

Customisable landing page for personal links

Tasteful, fast, and minimal — not like bloated aggregators

Hosted Pages

Markdown-based or curated content pages hosted directly on pesos.site

Designed to feel permanent, elegant, and low-maintenance

📰 PESOS Magazine (Optional Feature)

A browsable magazine of public highlights

Curated or algorithmic display of saved items from across the site

Permissions model TBD (likely opt-in or anonymous default)

📧 Contact & Notifications

Current Problem:

No email or phone collected by default (limits recovery + updates)

Planned Fix:

Optional email field for login, recovery, updates

Optional mobile number or push setup

Notifications to Support:

✅ Backup succeeded

❌ Feed failed

🕒 No new items recently

Delivery Options:

Email

Mobile push

In-app badge or status message

🔚 Summary

PESOS should feel like a calm, trustworthy utility — something you rarely need to check, but feel great knowing is there. Power features exist, but the default experience is built on simplicity, reliability, and quiet competence.

# APPROACH

When you're working on a project, you'll be checking this file, todo.md, and chronicler.md. Remember to update this file and those files to be up-to-date with whatever I'm working on and what completed.

Remember to update chronicler each time you run through stuff so I know what sorts of things we've done and if they worked.

I don't need you to race ahead to the end of the project. Remember that it's better to have bite-sized projects that I can review and get things iteratively better over time rather than have everything attempted at once. That's never going to work.

# TASTE

Linear, Notion, and Apple look great. I want that sort of elegance.
I'm open to it feeling more artistic and whimsical but pro is probably best.
