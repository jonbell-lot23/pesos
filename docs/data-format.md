# Data Export Formats

PESOS lets you download your archived data at any time. Exports are available in three formats:

## JSON
- Complete representation of your user profile, connected sources and saved items.
- Ideal for backing up or importing into other tools.

## Markdown
- A readable summary where each item becomes a Markdown entry.
- Great for publishing or quick reviews.

## CSV
- Tabular data containing the same fields as the JSON export.
- Useful for spreadsheets or custom scripts.

All exports contain only your own content and can be generated from the dashboard. No additional authentication steps are required beyond being logged in.
