This is the official log of what has happened in PESOS. Every update should be dated and written clearly. This is not a commit log â€” it's a memory log.

**Renamed system tables with pesos_ prefix and implemented comprehensive login logging.**  
Successfully renamed `SystemStatus` and `SystemUpdateLog` tables to `pesos_SystemStatus` and `pesos_SystemUpdateLog` to maintain consistency with the project's naming convention. Updated the Prisma schema, regenerated the client, and synchronized the database using `npx prisma db push --force-reset`.

Enhanced the logging infrastructure to properly track user login events:
- Created enhanced middleware that logs user login events when accessing protected routes
- Added internal API endpoint `/api/internal/log-activity` for middleware and system logging
- Updated `getLocalUser` API to log successful user authentication events
- Maintained existing comprehensive logging in `createUser` API for user creation and conflict scenarios

**Implemented comprehensive test coverage for login logging functionality.**  
Created extensive test suites covering:
- `ActivityLogger` unit tests for all logging methods including renamed table functionality
- Internal log activity API endpoint tests with error handling and validation
- Integration tests for complete login logging flow from user creation to verification
- Error handling scenarios to ensure system stability even when logging fails

The system now provides full visibility into user authentication activities while maintaining the "calm confidence" approach - logging works silently in the background without affecting user experience. This addresses the original issue where login events weren't being logged and supports the admin dashboard's comprehensive activity monitoring capabilities.

**Built comprehensive admin dashboard and activity logging system.**  
Created a full-featured admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard` with extensive system monitoring capabilities. Implemented comprehensive activity logging infrastructure that tracks:

- User creation and login events
- System updates (every 3 hours) with detailed statistics
- Page views and API calls
- Feed sync operations
- Export requests and other user activities

The dashboard features a spreadsheet-like interface showing all system activity with filtering, pagination, and real-time statistics. Added new database tables (`ActivityLog`, `SystemUpdateLog`, `UserSessionLog`) and integrated logging into key endpoints like user creation and system updates.

This provides exactly what was requested - "LOTS of data based on everything that's happening across the system" in a classic log style that helps understand what the app is doing. The dashboard shows new users, logins, system updates, and errors with full historical tracking.

**Enhanced system transparency and monitoring capabilities.**  
The system now provides comprehensive visibility into all activities, supporting the "calm confidence" vision by giving clear insights into system health and user behavior. This moves PESOS closer to being a trustworthy, well-monitored service that users can rely on.

**Planned 5 new Codex tasks based on end state priorities.**  
Analyzed current project state and identified bite-sized, high-impact tasks aligned with the "calm, trustworthy" vision. Added tasks for: Enhanced Status Dashboard, Mobile Dashboard Experience, Admin Monitoring Dashboard, Notification System Foundation, and Data Export Enhancement. These tasks are designed to move PESOS closer to the minimal, elegant user experience described in the end state while building necessary production infrastructure.

**Reorganized todo.md structure.**  
Created new "Dashboard & Status" high-priority section and "Notifications & Communication" medium-priority section to better organize the growing task list. Emphasized tasks that support the core vision of calm confidence and quiet competence.

All three support files written. `end_state.md` is currently undefined.

**Logged current PESOS focus.**  
Jon is now focusing on clarifying outcomes and reducing stress. The system is meant to stay fun and aligned with energy, not pressure.
