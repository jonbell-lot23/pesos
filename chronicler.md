# CHRONICLER

This is the official log of what has happened in PESOS. Every update should be dated and written clearly. This is not a commit log â€” it's a memory log.

**Planned 5 new Codex tasks based on end state priorities.**  
Analyzed current project state and identified bite-sized, high-impact tasks aligned with the "calm, trustworthy" vision. Added tasks for: Enhanced Status Dashboard, Mobile Dashboard Experience, Admin Monitoring Dashboard, Notification System Foundation, and Data Export Enhancement. These tasks are designed to move PESOS closer to the minimal, elegant user experience described in the end state while building necessary production infrastructure.

**Reorganized todo.md structure.**  
Created new "Dashboard & Status" high-priority section and "Notifications & Communication" medium-priority section to better organize the growing task list. Emphasized tasks that support the core vision of calm confidence and quiet competence.

**Wrote `agents.md` scaffold.**  
Codex will now refer to `end_state.md`, `todo.md`, and `chronicler.md` during every invocation.

**Created scaffolding files.**  
All three support files written. `end_state.md` is currently undefined.

**Logged current PESOS focus.**  
Jon is now focusing on clarifying outcomes and reducing stress. The system is meant to stay fun and aligned with energy, not pressure.
