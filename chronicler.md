# CHRONICLER

This is the official log of what has happened in PESOS. Every update should be dated and written clearly. This is not a commit log â€” it's a memory log.

**Built comprehensive admin dashboard and activity logging system.**  
Created a full-featured admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard` with extensive system monitoring capabilities. Implemented comprehensive activity logging infrastructure that tracks:

- User creation and login events
- System updates (every 3 hours) with detailed statistics
- Page views and API calls
- Feed sync operations
- Export requests and other user activities

The dashboard features a spreadsheet-like interface showing all system activity with filtering, pagination, and real-time statistics. Added new database tables (`ActivityLog`, `SystemUpdateLog`, `UserSessionLog`) and integrated logging into key endpoints like user creation and system updates.

This provides exactly what was requested - "LOTS of data based on everything that's happening across the system" in a classic log style that helps understand what the app is doing. The dashboard shows new users, logins, system updates, and errors with full historical tracking.

**Enhanced system transparency and monitoring capabilities.**  
The system now provides comprehensive visibility into all activities, supporting the "calm confidence" vision by giving clear insights into system health and user behavior. This moves PESOS closer to being a trustworthy, well-monitored service that users can rely on.

**Planned 5 new Codex tasks based on end state priorities.**  
Analyzed current project state and identified bite-sized, high-impact tasks aligned with the "calm, trustworthy" vision. Added tasks for: Enhanced Status Dashboard, Mobile Dashboard Experience, Admin Monitoring Dashboard, Notification System Foundation, and Data Export Enhancement. These tasks are designed to move PESOS closer to the minimal, elegant user experience described in the end state while building necessary production infrastructure.

**Reorganized todo.md structure.**  
Created new "Dashboard & Status" high-priority section and "Notifications & Communication" medium-priority section to better organize the growing task list. Emphasized tasks that support the core vision of calm confidence and quiet competence.

**Wrote `agents.md` scaffold.**  
Codex will now refer to `end_state.md`, `todo.md`, and `chronicler.md` during every invocation.

**Created scaffolding files.**  
All three support files written. `end_state.md` is currently undefined.

**Logged current PESOS focus.**  
Jon is now focusing on clarifying outcomes and reducing stress. The system is meant to stay fun and aligned with energy, not pressure.
