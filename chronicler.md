**Wrote `agents.md` scaffold.**  
Codex will now refer to `end_state.md`, `todo.md`, and `chronicler.md` during every invocation.

**Created scaffolding files.**  
All three support files written. `end_state.md` is currently undefined.

**Logged current PESOS focus.**  
Jon is now focusing on clarifying outcomes and reducing stress. The system is meant to stay fun and aligned with energy, not pressure.
